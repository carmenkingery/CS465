Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
  Express HTML: Traditional, server-side rendered pages, often simple and quick to develop. Limited in interactivity and not as dynamic as modern JavaScript frameworks.
  JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamism to web pages. Can make asynchronous requests to servers without reloading the entire page, improving user experience.
  SPA: Highly interactive, behaves like a desktop application. Loads all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in a single page load. Offers a seamless user experience with efficient data update and retrieval without page refreshes.
  We used MongoBD because it provides flexibility in handling data strsuctures, which is benificial for projects with evoloving data models. It also stores data in a json-like format, which facilitates a seemless integration with javasceipt-based frontend applications like ours.

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
  JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format, easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is a subset of JavaScript but is language-independent. It serves as the primary format for data exchange between the frontend and backend, ensuring seamless data flow and integration in full-stack development.
  Some benefits of reusable UI components include: enhanced code efficiency, reduced redundancy, it can speed up development time, and it facilitates consistent UI/UX across the application.

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
  In the full stack project, the approach to testing was comprehensive, focusing on both the functionality and security of the application. Utilizing a variety of HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, each API endpoint was meticulously tested to ensure accurate and reliable responses under different scenarios. This included verifying the correct functioning of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ensuring that the frontend and backend communicated effectively and data was handled appropriately. Additionally, a significant emphasis was placed on security testing. This involved implementing and testing authentication and authorization mechanisms to safeguard against unauthorized access to the API and protect sensitive data. By simulating various security threats and attempting to exploit potential vulnerabilities, the robustness of security layers was evaluated and strengthened. This thorough testing strategy not only enhanced the reliability and security of the application but also provided valuable insights into best practices for API testing in a full stack environment.
